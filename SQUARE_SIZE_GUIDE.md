# Quick Start Guide: Using the 8.5 × 8.5 Square Size

## How to Use the New Square Format

### Step 1: Select the Square Trim Size
1. Open your coloring book project
2. Navigate to the **Print Settings** section in the sidebar
3. Click the **TRIM SIZE** dropdown
4. Select **"8.5 x 8.5 inches (Square)"**
5. You'll see the after-trim dimensions update to: **"After-Trim: 8.75 × 8.75 in"**

### Step 2: Enable Bleed (Recommended for KDP)
1. In the same Print Settings section
2. Check the **"Bleed (0.125″)"** checkbox
3. This adds the required 0.125″ bleed on all four sides for KDP printing

### Step 3: Adjust Margins for Square Format
The default margins work well, but you can customize them:

**Recommended Margins for Square Kids' Books:**
- **Top**: 0.5″ (provides space at top of page)
- **Bottom**: 0.75″ (room for page numbers if enabled)
- **Inner/Gutter**: 0.75″ to 1.0″ (important for binding - prevents content loss)
- **Outer**: 0.5″ (edge margin)

**Why Inner Margin Matters:**
The inner margin (gutter) is where the book binds. For square books, especially with thicker page counts, increase this to 0.875″ or 1.0″ to ensure text and images don't get lost in the binding.

### Step 4: Preview Your Pages
1. The **Live Preview** pane automatically updates to show square pages
2. Use the zoom controls to inspect details
3. Navigate between spreads to see how content adapts
4. Check that illustrations and text fit well in the square format

### Step 5: Export Your PDF
1. Go to the **Export** section
2. Click **"Export PDF"**
3. Your PDF will be generated at 8.5 × 8.5 inches (or 8.75 × 8.75 with bleed)
4. The file is ready to upload to Amazon KDP

## What Automatically Adapts

✅ **Story Pages**: Text and tracing words scale to fit square dimensions
✅ **Illustration Pages**: Images maintain aspect ratio and fill the square page
✅ **Front Matter**: Title, copyright, dedication pages adapt to square layout
✅ **Back Matter**: Ending pages scale proportionally
✅ **Activity Pages**: Writing practice lines adjust to page width
✅ **Decorative Elements**: Icons, borders, and accents position correctly
✅ **Page Numbers**: If enabled, position at bottom center or bottom outer

## Design Tips for Square Format

### 1. **Balanced Compositions**
Square pages create symmetrical, balanced layouts. This is perfect for:
- Children's picture books
- Coloring books
- Activity books
- Storybooks with illustrations

### 2. **Illustration Sizing**
- Full-bleed illustrations work beautifully in square format
- Consider the 1:1 aspect ratio when creating or selecting images
- Square images (1000×1000px or larger) fit perfectly without cropping

### 3. **Text Density**
- Square pages have slightly less vertical space than 8.5×11
- Keep paragraphs concise and well-spaced
- Use the template's body size settings to adjust text if needed

### 4. **Gutter Awareness**
- Keep important text and images away from the inner margin
- Test with a physical mockup if possible
- For 100+ page books, increase inner margin to 1.0″

## KDP Upload Settings

When uploading to Amazon KDP, use these settings:

**Paperback Details:**
- **Trim Size**: 8.5" × 8.5" (Square)
- **Bleed Settings**: Bleed
- **Paper Type**: White or Cream (your choice)
- **Interior Type**: Black & White or Color

- **Resolution**: 300 DPI minimum for images

## Troubleshooting

### Content Appears Cut Off
- **Solution**: Increase the inner (gutter) margin to 0.875″ or 1.0″
- **Why**: Thicker books need more gutter space

### Images Look Stretched
- **Solution**: Use square images (1:1 aspect ratio) or adjust illustration fit/scale
- **Why**: Non-square images may need manual adjustment

### Text Too Large/Small
- **Solution**: Adjust body size in the template settings
- **Why**: Square format may need different text sizing than rectangular pages

### Preview Looks Different from PDF
- **Solution**: Always check the exported PDF before uploading
- **Why**: Preview is scaled for screen viewing; PDF is exact print dimensions
